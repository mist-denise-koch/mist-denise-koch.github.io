       <br>
		<li><font size="+2"><strong>Collaborate in real-time.</strong> Easily work on documents, spreadsheets, and slides across your devices, with or without internet. Work in a single document with teammates or people outside your company.See edits as others type, communicate through built-in chat, and ask questions in comments. Multiple people can work at the same time, and every change is saved automatically.</font></li>
		<br>	
		<li><font size="+2"><strong>Store and share files in the cloud.</strong> Keep all your work in one place with secure access from your computer, phone, or tablet. Quickly invite others to view, download, and collaborate on any file – no email attachment needed. File updates are automatically saved and stored in Drive, so everyone can always have access to the latest version.</font></li>
		<br>	
		<li><font size="+2"><strong>Secure your data and devices.</strong> Protect your company’s data with security options like 2-step verification and single-sign-on, and use endpoint management to keep your data safe in the case of a lost device or employee turnover. Archive email messages and on-the-record chats, and control how long they are retained. Easily configure security settings from a centralized administration console, and call or email Google support for help 24/7.</font></li>
